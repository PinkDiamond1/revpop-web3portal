# Fees

In the RevPop ecosystem every operation is assigned an *individual* fee.
These fees are subject to change throughout test net. Once in main net,
they will be iterated upon solely by token holder approval, thus
each and every token holder of the RevPop core
asset (RVP) has a say as to what the fees should be. If token holders can be
convinced to reduce a certain fee and consensus is reached, the fee will be
reduced automatically by the blockchain. Changes of blockchain parameters are
proposed by members of the committee. These members are voted by token holders
and improve the flexibility and reaction rate.

\*: These operations require Lifetime membership!
